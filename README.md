Tests
=====

This starter kit comes with an integration test sample, written for QUnit runner. 

You can run the tests by opening the `http://localhost:4567?test` page in your browser.

The test is located in the `source/tests/tests.js` file. You can see how such an 
integration test should be written, using QUnit assertions and ember-testing helpers.
